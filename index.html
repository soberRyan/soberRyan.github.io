    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 1</h2>
      <p>
        Step 1 in AA is about admitting, deep down, that we are alcoholics. 
        For me, that meant shifting from self-pity to an empowering realization 
        that I <em>get</em> to be an alcoholic. Recognizing my addictive personality 
        helped me focus my work on the remaining steps, establishing a connection 
        with God, and letting go of long-held resentments, fears, anxieties, and 
        depression. Some sponsors suggest making two lists—how alcohol rendered 
        you powerless and how it made your life unmanageable—but my biggest 
        hurdle was fully embracing that I was an alcoholic instead of forever 
        searching for a way to drink “like a normal person.”
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <p>
        Step 2 is about coming to believe that a power greater than ourselves 
        can restore us to sanity. At first, I didn't want to admit that 
        alcohol, drugs, and my behavior had driven me to insanity. Nor did I 
        embrace the notion of God, believing Him akin to Santa Claus or the 
        Tooth Fairy. Many in recovery define God in different ways—“group of 
        drunks,” “good orderly direction,” or otherwise. Over time, I started 
        to see God as Love and the universal energy present in everyone and 
        everything. I believe God speaks through people, experiences, and 
        particularly my intuition. This viewpoint took a long time to shape, 
        and I work continuously to nurture it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 3</h2>
      <p>
        Step 3 focuses on turning our will and our lives over to God as we 
        understand Him. This was a tough step for me and one that I have to 
        re-commit to daily. Each morning, I pray for guidance in my thoughts 
        and actions—those being the essence of <em>my will and my life</em>. 
        I believe God's will is for me to be the best version of myself and 
        to help others. It's easy to slip back into “my will,” so I keep 
        this step alive by praying, believing, and following that inner 
        nudge toward the next right action.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 4</h2>
      <p>
        Step 4 involves taking a searching and fearless moral inventory of 
        ourselves. While it was easy to dwell on my flaws internally, the 
        real relief came when I wrote them down, prayed about them, and 
        shared them with my sponsor. I also find value in revisiting Step 4 
        multiple times as I continue in sobriety. As more insights emerge—often 
        when I’m helping others through their inventory—my own understanding 
        deepens and evolves.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 5</h2>
      <p>
        Step 5 is about admitting to God, ourselves, and another human being 
        the exact nature of our wrongs. It usually means reading through 
        our Step 4 inventory with a sponsor, accompanied by prayer. This kind 
        of honesty often lifts shame and guilt that can keep us stuck in the past.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Steps 6 and 7</h2>
      <p>
        Steps 6 and 7 deal with becoming entirely ready for God to remove our 
        character defects, and then humbly asking Him to do so. They're closely 
        connected, and it's easy to mix up their specific wording. In essence, 
        Step 6 is about willingness, and Step 7 is about surrender—asking God 
        for the help we need to truly let go of these defects.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 8</h2>
      <p>
        Step 8 involves listing all the people we've harmed and becoming willing 
        to make amends to them. Just like Step 4, my list has grown over time as 
        I remember more incidents or recognize new ways my actions affected others. 
        Though it might sound overwhelming, it’s primarily a preparation step— 
        Step 9 is where the actual amends take place.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 9</h2>
      <p>
        Step 9 is about making direct amends whenever possible, unless doing so 
        would harm someone else. In my experience, amends I've made have always 
        gone better than I feared and have helped restore or improve relationships. 
        They often brought unexpected blessings and gave me a deeper understanding 
        of both myself and the people I harmed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 10</h2>
      <p>
        Step 10 instructs us to continue taking personal inventory and admit 
        when we’re wrong without delay. This involves daily checks on my resentments, 
        fears, or situations where I might owe an amends. Regularly returning 
        to the previous steps—and helping others work through them—keeps me 
        accountable and aware of my growth areas.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 11</h2>
      <p>
        Step 11 encourages prayer (talking to God) and meditation (listening to God). 
        I don’t do this as consistently as I’d like, but I definitely notice a 
        difference on days I start with prayer and meditation. I also view my 
        daily thoughts as a form of prayer, so I monitor what I’m dwelling on. 
        I like having free-flow, conversational prayers with God in my head, 
        and I practice mindfulness by remaining present. Focusing on the past 
        can lead to depression, while worrying about the future can trigger 
        anxiety. Staying in the <em>now</em> keeps me more in tune with God’s presence.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 12</h2>
      <p>
        Step 12 is about carrying the message to other alcoholics and practicing 
        these principles in all our affairs. It’s easier to keep the principles 
        in play during meetings or while helping another person in recovery. 
        The real challenge is in daily life, especially when I’m alone or at home. 
        Showing up for meetings, doing service work, and supporting newcomers 
        keeps me active in Step 12.
